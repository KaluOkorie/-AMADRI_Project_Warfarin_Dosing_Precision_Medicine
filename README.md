# AMADRI Project: Warfarin Dosing Precision Medicine

## Project Overview
AMADRI is a healthcare data science initiative to develop an AI-driven dosing recommendation engine for Warfarin, 
one of the world's most commonly prescribed anticoagulants with a narrow therapeutic window. 
This repository contains Step 1: Data Acquisition Pipeline of the complete workflow.

## Business Problem
Warfarin dosing presents significant clinical and operational challenges:

- Patient Harm: Small dosing errors cause severe bleeding or clotting events
- Financial Strain: Warfarin-related adverse events cost thousands per incident in extended hospital stays
- Operational Inefficiency: Clinicians spend excessive time on manual trial-and-error dosing

## Business Objectives
- Clinical: Reduce Warfarin-related adverse events by ≥25% within 6-12 months
- Operational: Automate dosing decision support, reducing clinician workload by 30%
- Strategic: Establish market leadership in precision dosing for anticoagulant therapy
